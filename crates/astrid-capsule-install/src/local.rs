//! Install a capsule from a directory on disk.
//!
//! By the time we get here, the source has already been resolved to
//! a real directory containing a `Capsule.toml`. GitHub clones and
//! `.capsule` archive unpacks — all of that happens in the CLI
//! before this is called. Archive unpack
//! lives in [`crate::archive::unpack_and_install`], which staged the
//! archive into a tempdir and then forwards here.
//!
//! ## Order
//!
//! Windows user installs validate or provision the private Astrid and
//! principal boundaries before any read traverses the principal namespace.
//!
//! Pre-flight reads happen before any mutation of `target_dir`:
//!
//! 1. Parse manifest.
//! 2. Check export conflicts (advisory).
//! 3. Hash WASM at source → `bin/<hash>.wasm`.
//! 4. Hash WIT at source → `wit/store/<hash>.wit`.
//!
//! If any of those fail we haven't touched `target_dir` and the
//! existing install is intact. Only then do we:
//!
//! 5. Provision the remaining user or checked-workspace target boundary.
//! 6. Backup existing `target_dir` (rename to `.bak`).
//! 7. Copy non-WASM tree → `target_dir` (excludes `*.wasm` and
//!    `wit/`).
//! 8. Preserve durable env state through daemon control storage; no native
//!    env file is copied from the backup.
//! 9. Run lifecycle hook with bytes from `bin/`.
//! 10. Write `meta.json`.
//! 11. Cleanup backup.
//!
//! Failure after step 7 restores the backup over `target_dir`.
