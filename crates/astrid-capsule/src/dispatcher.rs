//! Event dispatcher for routing events to capsule interceptors.
//!
//! The dispatcher is a host-side async task that subscribes to the global
//! `EventBus`, matches incoming events against capsule interceptor patterns
//! (from `Capsule.toml`), and invokes the corresponding WASM
//! `astrid_hook_trigger` export on each matching capsule.
//!
//! # Event Routing
//!
//! The dispatcher handles two categories of events:
//!
//! - **IPC events**: matched by their `topic` field (e.g. `user.prompt`)
//! - **Lifecycle events**: matched by `event_type()` (e.g. `tool_call_started`,
//!   `session_created`). This enables WASM capsules (like the Hook Bridge) to
//!   subscribe to lifecycle events and apply policy (merge strategies, hook
//!   fan-out) on top of the kernel's dispatch mechanism.
//!
//! All dispatch is fire-and-forget from the dispatcher's perspective. Capsules
//! that need request-response semantics (e.g. collecting responses from multiple
//! subscribers) use `hooks::trigger` — the kernel syscall for fan-out with
//! response collection.
//!
//! # Topic Matching
//!
//! Interceptor event patterns support:
//! - Exact match: `user.prompt` matches only `user.prompt`
//! - Single-segment wildcard: `tool.execute.*.result` matches
//!   `tool.execute.search.result` but not `tool.execute.result`
