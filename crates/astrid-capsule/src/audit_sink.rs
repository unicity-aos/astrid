//! Bounded asynchronous host-audit sink: the seam by which sensitive per-action
//! host calls (fs read/write/delete, net connect/bind, process spawn)
//! reach the kernel's durable, signed, hash-chained audit log.
//!
//! # Why a sink trait rather than a direct append
//!
//! This WASM host engine has no dependency on `astrid-audit` and no
//! custody of the runtime ed25519 signing key (the key lives kernel-side,
//! `Arc`-shared into the audit log). It therefore cannot construct or sign
//! an audit entry itself. Instead a host fn reports a neutral, primitives-
//! only [`HostAuditEvent`] + [`HostAuditOutcome`] to this trait; the kernel
//! implements the trait (it holds both the audit log and the key), maps the
//! event onto its internal `AuditAction`, and appends + signs it.
//!
//! # Why bounded asynchronous
//!
//! Host calls enqueue a bounded, host-owned record and return without waiting
//! for an individual storage commit. A dedicated kernel writer records each
//! principal's calls in call order, coalesces consecutive calls losslessly,
//! and writes a signed loss record for calls a full queue could not hold, so
//! a gap is visible on the chain itself. Per-action audit deliberately does
//! NOT route over the event bus: the bus is broadcast-with-lag-drop, and a
//! droppable record is not a provable one. The chain append remains the
//! system of record.
//!
//! # Fail-closed classes
//!
//! An operator may configure host-call classes that fail closed. For those,
//! the host fn calls [`HostAuditSink::admit`] after its security gate and
//! before the effect; the effect runs only once a write-ahead entry is
//! durable.

/// Variants borrow their string payloads from the host fn's own stack —
/// no allocation on the report path. The kernel-side implementation owns
/// the mapping from these neutral events onto its internal audit-action

/// an accepted record without a trace on the chain: a call that cannot be
/// recorded individually must still be counted by a signed loss record.
/// Records of one principal must reach the chain in call order. A worker or
/// persistence failure must be exposed through the implementation's operator
/// health surface. Graceful shutdown must drain accepted records before
/// closing the authoritative audit projection.
///
/// Implementations **MUST** stamp the `principal` argument exactly as
/// passed. The host fn derives that principal from trusted, host-populated
/// state ([`effective_principal`](crate::engine::wasm::host_state::HostState::effective_principal)),
/// never from guest-supplied data; an implementation that re-derived the
/// principal from the event payload would reintroduce a forgery seam.
///
/// A persistence failure must not panic the host call; it degrades to
/// "continue + alert" and remains visible in health. The host fn has already
/// decided allow/deny by the time it reports; [`record`](Self::record) is a
/// side effect, never a gate. The only gate is [`admit`](Self::admit), and
/// only for classes the operator configured as fail-closed.
