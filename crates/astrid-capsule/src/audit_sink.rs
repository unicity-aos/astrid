//! Bounded asynchronous host-audit sink: the seam by which sensitive per-action
//! host calls (fs read/write/delete, net connect/bind, process spawn, HTTP
//! exchanges) reach the kernel's durable, signed, hash-chained audit log.
//!
//! # Why a sink trait rather than a direct append
//!
//! This WASM host engine has no dependency on `astrid-audit` and no
//! custody of the runtime ed25519 signing key (the key lives kernel-side,
//! `Arc`-shared into the audit log). It therefore cannot construct or sign
//! an audit entry itself. Instead a host fn reports a neutral, primitives-
//! only [`HostAuditEvent`] + [`HostAuditOutcome`] to this trait; the kernel
//! implements the trait (it holds both the audit log and the key), maps the
//! event onto its internal `AuditAction`, and appends + signs it.
//!
//! # Why bounded asynchronous
//!
//! Host calls enqueue a bounded, host-owned record and return without waiting
//! for an individual storage commit. A dedicated kernel writer records each
//! principal's calls in call order, coalesces consecutive calls of one capsule
//! losslessly, and writes a signed loss record for calls a full queue could
//! not hold, so a gap is visible on the chain itself. Per-action audit
//! deliberately does NOT route over the event bus: the bus is
//! broadcast-with-lag-drop, and a droppable record is not a provable one. The
//! chain append remains the system of record.
//!
//! The exception is an effect whose record must precede it. The HTTP host
//! awaits [`HostAuditSink::commit`] for every outbound request, so the request
//! entry is durable before the request leaves the host. A committed record
//! takes its place in the same per-chain order as queued ones.
//!
//! # Fail-closed classes
//!
//! An operator may configure host-call classes that fail closed. For those,
//! the host fn calls [`HostAuditSink::admit`] after its security gate and
//! before the effect; the effect runs only once a write-ahead entry is
//! durable.
