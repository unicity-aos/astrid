//! Per-capsule pool of WASM instances for concurrent interceptor invocation.
//!
//! Before the pool, each non-run-loop capsule had a single `Store<HostState>`
//! behind one mutex, so `invoke_interceptor` serialised every invocation
//! through that one instance — the throughput floor behind the
//! `astrid#813` orchestration cliff (one LLM turn every ~3s, invariant to
//! concurrency, measured directly as a 2000+ deep invocation backlog on one
//! Store; see `astrid#816`).
//!
//! A [`CapsuleInstancePool`] holds N independent `(Store, Instance)` pairs
//! built from the same compiled component. Invocations lease a free instance
//! and run genuinely concurrently within one authority-scoped runtime.
//!
//! ## Free checkout
//!
//! Any available instance serves any invocation for the runtime's one durable
//! principal. This is sound because guest state never crosses PrincipalUid and
//! interceptor capsules use wasmtime resources (subscriptions, HTTP streams)
//! *within* a single invocation (subscribe → publish → recv → drop in one
//! call), so no handle created on one Store is reused on another. The
//! per-capsule pool-safety audit confirmed this for every pooled capsule;
//! the one capsule that holds a live resource across invocations
//! (`astrid-capsule-shell`'s background-process handles) is carved out to
//! `size == 1` via its `host_process` capability and so never leases a
//! second Store.
//!
//! ## Run-loop capsules are not pooled
//!
//! Capsules that export `run()` keep their single dedicated Store (owned by
//! the run-loop task) and never go through this pool — they receive events
//! via auto-subscribed IPC inside `run()`, not via `invoke_interceptor`.
