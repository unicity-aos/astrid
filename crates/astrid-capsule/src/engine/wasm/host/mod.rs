// Host registration is handled by [`Kernel::add_to_linker`] in
// `engine/wasm/mod.rs`, which wires every per-domain `Host` /
// `HostResource` trait impl on `HostState` into the wasmtime `Linker`.
//
// The legacy `astrid:capsule/types` interface was split into per-domain
// type modules when the WIT was sharded (see `wit/host/`), so there is
// no longer a single empty `types::Host` trait to implement.

// `lifecycle` is the package providing `capsule-result` used by the
// guest's `astrid-hook-trigger` export. It defines only types — the
// generated `Host` trait is empty — but bindgen still emits the trait,
// so the kernel needs to assert it on `HostState` for the linker
// scaffolding to type-check.

// `astrid:io/poll` is implemented in `host/io.rs` — kernel-owned with
// audit + cancel-token + per-principal accounting. The wasi:io/poll
// forwarder used during the initial scaffolding pass has been removed:
// no wasi:* interface is exposed to capsules.
