//! `astrid:ipc@1.0.0` host implementation.
//!
//! Subscriptions are first-class wasmtime resources. `subscribe` allocates
//! a [`RoutedEventReceiver`] against the kernel event bus, stores it in
//! the capsule's resource table, and hands back a `Resource<Subscription>`.
//! All drop / lifetime / cross-capsule isolation rides wasmtime's
//! resource machinery — there is no parallel `HashMap<u64, EventReceiver>`
//! on `HostState` anymore.
//!
//! Per-(capsule, topic, principal) isolation lives one layer down in
//! `astrid_events::route`: each guest subscription gets its own routed
//! entry in the bus's `routes` table, with per-principal FIFO queues
//! drained under deficit-round-robin. The legacy "pending bucket
//! requeue" workaround that lived here is gone — routed receivers
//! never see mixed-principal batches in the first place because the
//! demux happens publish-side, not consumer-side.
//!
//! Audit envelope: every publish / publish-as / subscribe / poll / recv
//! / drop emits a tracing event under `target = "astrid.audit.ipc"` with
//! capsule + principal + topic + message count. Blocking `recv` races
//! against the calling capsule's cancellation token so capsule unload
//! always wins over a stuck wait.
