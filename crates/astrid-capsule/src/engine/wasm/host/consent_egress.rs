//! Runtime operator-consent for capsule local-egress (issue #1028).
//!
//! After the SSRF-airlock hardening closed the accidental `http://127.0.0.1`
//! IP-literal bypass, the only sanctioned way for a capsule to reach a
//! loopback/private LLM endpoint is the operator allowlist
//! `[security.capsule_local_egress]` (snapshotted onto [`HostState::local_egress`]).
//! That allowlist must be set ahead of time. This module is the **runtime**
//! complement: when a capsule's egress hits the airlock-rejected arm for an
//! IP-literal local endpoint, and the request demonstrably came from a *local
//! operator* (a `LocalSocket` transport origin), the host elicits one-shot
//! consent via the existing approval primitive and — on approve — lets the
//! in-flight request through.
//!
//! # Why transport origin is load-bearing
//!
//! The gateway `POST /agent` drives the SAME react/openai-compat egress path a
//! local CLI prompt does. A remote bearer caller therefore reaches the same
//! egress site as a local operator. The ONLY thing that distinguishes them is
//! the host-stamped [`MessageOrigin`](astrid_events::ipc::MessageOrigin): a
//! `LocalSocket` request is a verified local operator; a `RemoteGateway` (or
//! `System`, or unbound) request is not. Consent is therefore gated on
//! `effective_origin() == LocalSocket` and fails closed for everything else —
//! a remote user can never trigger a local-egress prompt, let alone grant one.
//!
//! # Scope (v1)
//!
//! Covers IP-LITERAL local endpoints (`127.0.0.1:port`, `[::1]:port`,
//! `192.168.x`, `10.x`, `169.254.x`) — the airlock-rejected arm of
//! [`egress_decision`](super::http). HOSTNAME endpoints (`localhost:1234`,
//! resolved through `SafeDnsResolver`) are NOT consent-granted in v1; they still
//! require an operator pre-bless. See the call site in `host/http.rs`.
//!
//! # Grant scoping
//!
//! The runtime grant is **per-principal AND per-capsule** (keyed `principal` +
//! `capsule_id` + the network `host:port`), held in the shared
//! [`AllowanceStore`] — principal A's grant never exempts principal B (the store
//! buckets by principal), and capsule A's grant never exempts capsule B even for
//! the same principal (the [`AllowancePattern::NetworkHost`] carries the
//! `capsule_id` and the matcher requires it to match). The `approve_always`
//! persistence mirrors this: it writes to the capsule-keyed
//! `profile.network.capsule_egress[<capsule>]` map, not a flat per-principal
//! list, so a remembered grant likewise cannot widen across capsules. The
//! operator pre-bless (`[security.capsule_local_egress]`) stays capsule-keyed
//! and unchanged.
//!
//! # Persistence is honored at runtime ("remember across restarts")
//!
//! The in-memory [`AllowanceStore`] starts EMPTY on every daemon boot, so the
//! in-memory grant alone cannot survive a restart. To actually keep the
//! `approve_always` promise, the gate ALSO consults the on-disk
//! `profile.network.capsule_egress[<capsule>]` for the effective principal
//! before eliciting (see [`has_persisted_grant`] and step 3 of
//! [`consent_local_egress`](HostState::consent_local_egress)) — the same way it
//! already consults the operator pre-bless allowlist
//! ([`HostState::local_egress`]), just per-principal from the profile. The
//! persisted consult preserves both isolation axes: it reads only THIS
//! capsule's bucket in THIS principal's profile, so a remembered grant for
//! capsule A / principal X never permits capsule B / principal Y. It is reached
//! only AFTER the upstream origin gate (`LocalSocket` only) and SSRF airlock, so
//! it short-circuits the elicitation — never the origin/airlock checks.
//!
//! # Revocation requires a daemon restart (no live revocation)
//!
//! Neither exemption source is revoked live; both take effect on the **next
//! daemon start**, so an operator who edits config (or deletes a grant) to
//! revoke is NOT immediately protected:
//!
//! - **Operator pre-bless** (`[security.capsule_local_egress]`) is read into a
//!   load-time snapshot ([`HostState::local_egress`], cloned per pooled instance
//!   at capsule load). Removing or narrowing an entry has no effect on a running
//!   daemon — the snapshot is fixed at load and only re-read on restart.
//! - **Persisted `approve_always` grant**
//!   (`profile.network.capsule_egress[<capsule>]`) is consulted through a
//!   process-lifetime `PrincipalProfileCache` with no TTL or file watcher.
//!   Deleting the on-disk grant (or revoking the bless that authorized it) does
//!   not evict the cached profile, so the grant keeps permitting local egress
//!   until the daemon restarts and the cache is rebuilt.
//!
//! This is a deliberate v1 limitation: the gate is fail-secure on the GRANT path
//! (it never grants more than the snapshot/cache allows) but is NOT fail-secure
//! on the REVOKE path within a single daemon lifetime. A live-revocation verb is
//! tracked separately; until it lands, revocation = edit config / delete grant
//! **then restart the daemon**. The CLI add-path prints this caveat at grant
//! time so an operator is not falsely reassured a later config edit revokes.
