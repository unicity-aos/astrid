// `astrid-hook-trigger` to its mandatory stub set, this trio MUST be
// extended to include it — otherwise every capsule will appear to

// events into a no-op trap. See `wasm_exports_contain` callers in
// the interceptor / hook-bridge paths for the affected branches.

/// for every mandatory WIT `func()` export the source crate doesn't
/// implement — `run`, `astrid-install`, `astrid-upgrade` — and points all

// ── Wasmtime epoch/memory/fuel integration tests ─────────────────────────
//
// These instantiate REAL guests (minimal core-wasm modules assembled from WAT
// via `Module::new`, which wasmtime accepts directly) on an engine built by
// the production [`build_wasmtime_engine`], and exercise the SAME mechanisms
// the load path applies to the dedicated run-loop Store:
//
//   * run-loop CPU bound — an epoch deadline + `epoch_deadline_callback` whose
//     body calls the PRODUCTION pure [`epoch_decision`] (Defect 3: no copies),
//     reading + writing the `recv_yielded` / `no_yield_windows` state exactly
//     as the load path does. A pure `loop {}` (no recv) is Interrupt-trapped
//     after `MAX_NO_YIELD_WINDOWS` and never starves the worker; a guest that
//     calls a recv-marking host import every iteration survives forever.
//   * memory cap          — `StoreLimitsBuilder::memory_size(cap)` BEFORE
//     `instantiate_async` (the MEMORY-ORDERING fix — `make_state`).
//   * fuel-delta meter     — `INTERCEPTOR_FUEL_BUDGET - get_fuel()` after a
//     call (the kept interceptor measurement).
//
// Core modules (not full WIT components) are deliberate: they exercise the
// SAME wasmtime epoch/`StoreLimits`/fuel primitives the engine relies on with
// zero external `.wasm` fixture and no wasi-sdk/QuickJS component build, so
// they carry none of the CI disk-SIGBUS risk (MEMORY.md
// project_ci_test_disk_sigbus) that gating a component build would. They reuse
// the production `build_wasmtime_engine` + `spawn_epoch_ticker` anchors. The
// pure `resolve_run_loop_budget` / `epoch_decision` tests above gate the
// *policy*; these gate the *enforcement primitive* wired to that policy.
