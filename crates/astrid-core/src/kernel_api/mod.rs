//! Kernel management API request and response types.
//!
//! These types describe the CLI ↔ daemon RPC surface (admin requests,
//! status queries, capsule lifecycle ops). They live in `astrid-core`
//! because they reference `PrincipalId` and `Quotas` from this crate.
//!
//! Capsule-facing IPC types live in `astrid-types` (which intentionally
//! has no dependency on `astrid-core` — it must compile on
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown` without dragging in the kernel).
