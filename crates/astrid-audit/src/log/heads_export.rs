//! Read-only chain-head snapshot and raw chain paging for external anchoring.
//!
//! Neither read holds the process-wide durable append lock across chains. A
//! chain's `(count, omitted_total, head, head_hash)` comes from its single
//! chain-metadata record, which appends and prunes replace with one
//! compare-and-swap each, so every head reported here is a committed state
//! of its own chain. The snapshot reads a chain's metadata and prune state
//! together under that lock, for just those reads. Different chains may be
//! read at slightly different instants; each head is an independent claim.
