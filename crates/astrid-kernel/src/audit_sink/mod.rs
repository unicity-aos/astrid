//! Kernel implementation of the capsule host-audit sink.
//!
//! The WASM host engine (`astrid-capsule`) reports sensitive per-action host
//! calls — fs read/write/delete, net connect/bind/accept, process spawn — to
//! the [`HostAuditSink`](astrid_capsule::HostAuditSink) trait. The kernel
//! holds both the durable audit log and the runtime ed25519 signing key, so
//! it is the side that can map those neutral events onto a signed,
//! hash-chained [`AuditEntry`](astrid_audit::AuditEntry).
//!
//! # Ordered, loss-accounted lane
//!
//! A host call is placed in its principal chain's FIFO (see [`lane`]) and the
//! host call returns. A dedicated writer (see [`writer`]) appends the FIFO in
//! order, so a chain's entries are in call order. Consecutive calls share one
//! entry that counts them and commits to each of them through a fold
//! ([`astrid_audit::host_call`]). A call that meets a full queue is counted
//! in a signed loss entry at its place in the chain, and a lane run that
//! stops without draining leaves a signed gap entry at the next start (see
//! [`marker`]). Producers never block on the queue.
