//! Kernel implementation of the capsule host-audit sink.
//!
//! The WASM host engine (`astrid-capsule`) reports sensitive per-action host
//! calls — fs read/write/delete, net connect/bind/accept, process spawn — and
//! the records around them (HTTP exchanges, tool calls, approval decisions) to
//! the [`HostAuditSink`](astrid_capsule::HostAuditSink) trait. The kernel
//! holds both the durable audit log and the runtime ed25519 signing key, so
//! it is the side that can map those neutral events onto a signed,
//! hash-chained [`AuditEntry`](astrid_audit::AuditEntry).
//!
//! # Ordered, loss-accounted lane
//!
//! A record is placed in its principal chain's FIFO (see [`lane`]) and the
//! host call returns. A dedicated writer (see [`writer`]) appends the FIFO in
//! order, so a chain's entries are in call order. Consecutive host calls of
//! one capsule share one entry that counts them and commits to each of them
//! through a fold ([`astrid_audit::host_call`]); a run never spans capsules,
//! and every other record is its own entry. A record that meets a full queue
//! is counted in a signed loss entry at its place in the chain, and a lane run
//! that stops without draining leaves a signed gap entry at the next start
//! (see [`marker`]). Producers never block on the queue.
//!
//! # Durable records
//!
//! [`HostAuditSink::commit`] (HTTP pre-commits and completions, answered
//! approval prompts) queues its record at the tail of the same FIFO and waits
//! until the entry is durable, so a committed record keeps its place in call
//! order. Only a failed append lets the caller continue first (and the record
//! stays queued); after the writer has stopped, the record is appended
//! directly. HTTP requests are numbered per principal and lane run: the `run_id`
//! of an HTTP entry is the lane run's epoch, which a gap entry names when that
//! run stopped without draining.
//!
//! # Fail-closed classes
//!
//! For host-call classes in `audit.host_fail_closed`, [`HostAuditSink::admit`]
//! queues a write-ahead entry and waits until it is durable before the effect
//! runs; if it cannot be recorded, the call is refused and the refusal is
//! recorded as a denial.
