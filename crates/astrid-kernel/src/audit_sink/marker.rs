//! Durable lane marker: detects a lane run that stopped without draining.
//!
//! The in-memory queue is lost when the daemon dies, so the lane keeps one
//! small record in kernel-owned storage: the current lane run (`epoch`), the
//! chains it has written to, and whether it closed cleanly. A chain is added
//! before the lane writes its first entry of the run there. Graceful shutdown
//! marks the run closed after the queue is fully drained.
//!
//! On the next start, a run that is not closed becomes a gap duty: a signed
//! gap entry in every chain the run registered, and one in the session's
//! system chain, which covers chains that were touched but not yet
//! registered. Duties stay in the marker until their entries are durable, so
//! a second crash does not lose them. A marker that cannot be read or parsed
//! says nothing about the previous run, so it is treated as an unclean stop
//! of an unknown run and replaced. A run whose marker cannot be written
//! records that about itself, because a crash would then go unnoticed.
