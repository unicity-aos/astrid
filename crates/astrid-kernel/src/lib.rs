//! Astrid Kernel - The core execution engine and IPC router.
//!
//! The Kernel is a pure, decentralized WASM runner. It contains no business
//! logic, no cognitive loops, and no network servers. Its sole responsibility
//! is to instantiate `astrid_events::EventBus`, load `.capsule` files into
//! the Extism sandbox, and route IPC bytes between them.

/// Kernel implementation of the capsule per-action host-audit sink.
///
/// Native-only: the [`HostAuditSink`](astrid_capsule::HostAuditSink) seam is
/// driven exclusively by the wasmtime host engine, which is itself native-only
/// (the WASM engine never runs on the browser profile). The sink is the last
/// synchronous caller of the now-async audit log, so it carries a native-gated
/// block-on bridge that must not exist on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
/// Operator retention controls for the system audit log.
