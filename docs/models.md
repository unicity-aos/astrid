# LLM model selection

Astrid routes every prompt to whichever LLM model the current principal has
chosen. The choice is stored per-principal by the registry capsule, survives
daemon restarts, and can be changed at any time without restarting the daemon
or reinstalling a capsule.

This document covers four topics:

1. [Picking a model at runtime](#picking-a-model-at-runtime) -- the `astrid models` commands
2. [Provider discovery](#provider-discovery) -- where the model list comes from
3. [Install-time onboarding](#install-time-onboarding) -- what `astrid init --distro` walks you through
4. [When no model is selected](#when-no-model-is-selected) -- the error you see and how to fix it

## Picking a model at runtime

The `models` verb is provided by the registry capsule. It is reachable through
two equivalent paths:

```sh
astrid models <subcommand> [args]          # bare shorthand
astrid capsule models <subcommand> [args]  # canonical capsule-verb form
```

Both invoke exactly the same handler over the capsule IPC bus. The bare form
resolves to the capsule verb because `models` is not a built-in `astrid`
top-level subcommand -- the external-subcommand catch-all in the CLI dispatches
any unrecognised word to the daemon's command registry.

### List available models

```sh
astrid models list
astrid models list --json
```

Without `--json`, the output is a human-readable table with one line per
model. The active model for the current principal is marked with `*`:

```
* openai:gpt-5.5       OpenAI GPT-5.5
  openai:gpt-5.4       OpenAI GPT-5.4
  openai:o3            OpenAI o3
```

With `--json`, each entry is a full JSON object carrying capability metadata:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "openai:gpt-5.5",
    "description": "OpenAI GPT-5.5",
    "request_topic": "llm.v1.request.generate.openai",
    "stream_topic": "llm.v1.stream.openai",
    "capabilities": ["text", "tools", "vision", "structured_output", "reasoning"],
    "context_window": 1050000,
    "max_output_tokens": 128000
  }
]
```

### Show the active model

```sh
astrid models current
astrid models current --json
```

Without `--json`: prints the canonical model id (e.g. `openai:gpt-5.5`), or
`none` if nothing is selected.

With `--json`: prints `{ "active": <full entry object> }`, or
`{ "active": null }` when nothing is selected.

### Set the active model

```sh
astrid models set <id>
```

`<id>` is resolved in order:

1. **Exact canonical match** -- if your input exactly equals a canonical
   `<capsule>:<model>` id (e.g. `openai:gpt-5.5`), it binds immediately.
2. **Bare model name** -- if your input uniquely matches the model portion of
   exactly one entry, it binds (e.g. `gpt-5.5` when only the `openai` capsule
   is installed).
3. **Qualified pass** -- if the bare pass is ambiguous and your input contains
   a colon, it is split on the first colon into `<capsule>:<model>` to
   disambiguate.

If the bare name matches more than one provider, the error tells you which
qualified ids to choose from:

```
ambiguous model; candidates: openai:gpt-5.4, openai-compat:gpt-5.4
```

Pass the qualified form to disambiguate:

```sh
astrid models set openai:gpt-5.4
astrid models set openai-compat:gpt-5.4
```

**Ollama note.** Ollama model names embed a colon (e.g. `llama3.3:70b`). These
work as bare ids because the resolver splits only on the FIRST colon -- the bare
pass sees `llama3.3:70b` as a single bare model name when it is uniquely served
by one provider. If two providers expose the same Ollama model, use the fully
qualified form: `ollama:llama3.3:70b`.

On success the command prints:

```
active model set to openai:gpt-5.5
```

The selection is persisted immediately in the registry capsule's per-principal
KV and takes effect on the next prompt.

### Clear the active model

```sh
astrid models unset
```

Clears the selection. The next prompt fails with the no-model error (see
[When no model is selected](#when-no-model-is-selected)) until you run
`astrid models set` again.

### Per-principal scope

Model selection is per-principal. Each principal's selection is stored
independently in the registry capsule's KV, scoped under that principal's
home directory. Changing the active model as `default` does not affect what
another principal (e.g. `claude-code`) is using, and vice versa.

If you connect as a non-default principal and no model has been selected for
that principal yet, the registry runs a discovery pass and auto-selects a
sensible default (the first-discovered capsule's default-hint model) so the
first prompt is not blocked.

### Machine-readable output

Any `models` subcommand accepts `--json` to emit JSON instead of human-readable
text. This is useful for scripts and dashboards:

```sh
# One-liner: print the currently selected model id
astrid models current --json | jq -r '.active.id // "none"'

# List all available models as a JSON array
astrid models list --json
```

Exit code is 0 on success, 1 on any error (unknown model, ambiguous input, etc.).

## Provider discovery

The model list is not static. When `astrid models list` runs (or when the
daemon boots), the registry capsule publishes a `llm.v1.request.describe`
broadcast and drains responses from every installed LLM provider capsule for a
500 ms window. Each provider responds with a list of `ProviderEntry` objects.

**One entry per model.** Each provider emits one entry per model it can serve.
The entry's `id` is the bare model name (e.g. `gpt-5.5`); the registry stamps
the canonical form (`openai:gpt-5.5`) using the provider's authenticated
capsule id. The entry includes:

- `request_topic` -- the IPC topic the provider subscribes to for generate requests
- `capabilities` -- what the model supports (`text`, `tools`, `vision`, `structured_output`, `reasoning`)
- `context_window` and `max_output_tokens`

Anti-shadowing: a provider's entry is only accepted when its self-reported
`request_topic` suffix authenticates against the kernel-stamped source id
(UUIDv5 of the capsule package name). A capsule cannot emit entries for a
provider it does not own.

### openai capsule

The `astrid-capsule-openai` capsule targets OpenAI's Responses API
(`POST /v1/responses`). It advertises models as follows:

- At describe time, it calls `GET {base_url}/v1/models` with the configured
  bearer (the `api_key` env field).
- Each returned id is enriched from a hardcoded capability catalog: exact match
  first, then longest-prefix match for dated snapshots
  (e.g. `gpt-5.4-2026-03-05` resolves to the `gpt-5.4` catalog row). Unknown
  ids get conservative defaults (`context_window: 128000`, `max_output_tokens:
  16384`, no vision/reasoning/structured-output).
- The configured `model` env field is always `entry[0]` in the response -- it
  is hoisted to the front (or prepended if the live list does not include it),
  so the registry's auto-select picks the operator's intended default.
- If the live query fails (missing key, network error, non-200 response), the
  capsule falls back to the full hardcoded catalog -- the same models you see
  in `astrid models list` on an offline install.

The default model env is `gpt-5.5` (overridable via
`astrid capsule config astrid-capsule-openai`).

### openai-compat capsule

The `astrid-capsule-openai-compat` capsule talks to any OpenAI-compatible HTTP
server (LM Studio, vLLM, llama.cpp, a remote OpenAI-compatible API) via
`POST /v1/chat/completions`. It uses the same discovery pattern:

- Calls `GET {base_url}/v1/models` with the configured bearer at describe time.
- Returns the live list enriched where possible. For local servers that expose
  no capability info, entries get conservative defaults; the operator can
  override `context_window` and `max_output_tokens` via
  `astrid capsule config astrid-capsule-openai-compat`.

Because the openai-compat capsule connects to an arbitrary endpoint, model ids
can be anything the server returns -- including names with embedded colons
(e.g. `llama3.3:70b`).

### Local LLM endpoints and the SSRF airlock

The `astrid:http` host capability runs all capsule outbound HTTP through an SSRF
airlock. Before every request, the airlock resolves the target hostname and
rejects it if the resolved address falls within any of the following ranges:

- Loopback: `127.0.0.0/8`, `::1`
- Private: `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`
- Link-local: `169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10`

This is on by default and cannot be widened from inside a capsule.

**Consequence for a local LLM server.** If you point the openai-compat capsule
at a server running on the same machine or on a LAN box -- LM Studio on
`127.0.0.1:1234`, Ollama on `127.0.0.1:11434`, llama.cpp, or a box at
`192.168.x.x` -- the airlock blocks both the describe call (`GET /v1/models`)
and every generate request at runtime. The capsule's model list comes back empty
and every prompt fails. A remote or public `base_url` (e.g. `api.openai.com` or
a cloud-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint) is unaffected.

**Install-time picker vs. runtime.** The onboarding step that fetches
`/v1/models` to build the model selection menu runs natively in the installer
process, not inside the WASM sandbox and not through the airlock. This means the
install-time model picker works fine against a local endpoint: you can select a
model, the install succeeds, and the config is written -- but every subsequent
runtime prompt fails because the capsule's HTTP is blocked. The gap between a
successful install and failing prompts is intentional (the installer needs to
reach local endpoints to enumerate models), but it can be confusing. If you see
an empty model list or prompt errors after configuring a local server, the
airlock is the most likely cause.

**Operator exemption.** To let the openai-compat capsule reach specific local
endpoints at runtime, an operator adds a `[security.capsule_local_egress]`
table to `config.toml`. This is an operator-only setting: a capsule's own
`Capsule.toml` cannot set it, and a project or workspace config layer cannot
widen it either.

```toml
[security.capsule_local_egress]
# host:port (or host:*) endpoints this capsule may reach even though they
# resolve to a local address.
"astrid-capsule-openai-compat" = ["127.0.0.1:1234", "192.168.1.50:11434"]
```

The exemption is scoped to the listed `host:port` pairs. It lifts the airlock
only for those entries -- it does not widen the capsule's `net` allowlist (which
is already `*` for openai-compat) or grant any other capability.

Wildcard port: `"127.0.0.1:*"` exempts all ports on that host. Prefer listing
exact ports to minimise exposure.

### Provider requests on the audit log

Every request a capsule sends through `astrid:http` is recorded on the signed
audit log. The host appends an `http_request` entry after the airlock and
security checks pass and waits for it to be written before the request leaves
the host. When the response has been read, or the exchange ends early, an
`http_response` entry follows. The two entries share a `sequence` number, and
the response entry also carries the request entry's id.

The `http_request` entry records the method, host, port and redirect hop. The
path and query, the capsule's request headers and the body are recorded only as
BLAKE3 hashes. The `http_response` entry records the status, provider request
ids such as `x-request-id`, and a BLAKE3 hash of the response body as the host
read it. The log never stores request or response content.

`sequence` is numbered per principal within one run of the host-audit lane
(one daemon run), identified by the entry's `run_id`, and every request takes a
number, including requests the airlock refuses. The numbers increase along the
principal's chain. A number without its own entry was either counted by a
`host_call_loss` entry of that chain (the host-audit queue was full) or is
missing; if the run stopped without draining its queue, the next start writes a
`host_call_gap` entry whose `epoch` is that `run_id`. The request and response
entries take their place in call order among the capsule's other host-call
entries on the chain.

Credentials are redacted before hashing. The redacted values are:

- credential headers (`Authorization`, `Cookie`, `X-Api-Key`, `api-key`,
  `x-goog-api-key` and similar);
- credential query parameters (`key`, `api_key`, `access_token`, `token`,
  `signature` and similar);
- any secret value the host gave the capsule through a secret-typed config key.

Each of them is replaced by `[REDACTED]`. A verifier who holds a request can
apply the same redaction and recompute its hashes.

### Host-injected provider credentials

A provider capsule does not need to read its API key at all. It can name the
secret in a request header, and the host fills in the value when it builds the
request:

```text
Authorization: Bearer {{secret:api_key}}
```

For example, `capsule-openai-compat` currently reads `api_key` with
`env::var("api_key")` and sets the header itself. To use injection instead, it
sets the header to the template above and stops reading the key. The key then
never enters guest memory, and the audit hashes cover the placeholder rather
than the key.

- `NAME` must be declared in the capsule's `Capsule.toml` as a secret-typed
  `[env]` key (`type = "secret"`). Any other name refuses the request with
  `capability-denied`. The value is looked up the same way as `get_config`:
  the invoking principal's secret first, then the host-wide one.
- Surrounding whitespace is trimmed from the value. If the secret is unset or
  blank, the header is omitted, so a keyless local endpoint gets no
  `Authorization` header, as it does today.
- Placeholders are substituted only in header values. In the URL or the body
  they are sent as written.
- On a redirect to a different origin, every header that carries a placeholder
  is dropped, along with `Authorization` and `Cookie`.
- The `http_request` audit entry lists the names of the injected secrets, never
  their values.

## Install-time onboarding

`astrid init --distro <source>` (and `astrid distro apply <source>`) walks you
through LLM provider setup when the selected distro includes provider capsules.

### Provider multi-select

LLM provider capsules declare `group = "llm"` in the `Distro.toml`. The
installer presents them as a multi-select list:

```
Which LLM providers do you want to set up?
  [x] OpenAI (astrid-capsule-openai)
  [ ] OpenAI-compatible (astrid-capsule-openai-compat)
```

Select as many as you want. Each selected provider is then onboarded in
sequence.

### Per-provider configuration

For each selected provider, the installer prompts for credentials and a default
model:

```
This capsule requires configuration:
  Enter the OpenAI API base URL [https://api.openai.com]:
  Enter your OpenAI API key (secret, input hidden): sk-...
```

After credentials are collected, the installer fetches `GET {base_url}/v1/models`
with the bearer you just entered to build a live numbered menu of models:

```
Default model to select:
  1: gpt-5.5
  2: gpt-5.4
  3: gpt-5.4-mini
  ...
Select [1-N]: 
```

The configured default is pre-selected (item 1). If the endpoint cannot be
reached during install, the installer falls back to a free-text entry prompt
for the model id.

> **Local server users:** the install-time fetch above runs natively and is not
> subject to the SSRF airlock, so onboarding succeeds even for a loopback or
> LAN endpoint. Runtime requests from the capsule are blocked by the airlock
> until you add an operator exemption. See
> [Local LLM endpoints and the SSRF airlock](#local-llm-endpoints-and-the-ssrf-airlock).

The mechanism behind this is the `options_from` field in the capsule's
`[env]` manifest:

```toml
[env]
model = { type = "select", request = "Default model to select",
          default = "gpt-5.5",
          options_from = { http = "{base_url}/v1/models",
                           bearer = "{api_key}",
                           select = "data[].id",
                           after = ["base_url", "api_key"] } }
```

The installer fetches client-side, attaches the bearer only to the configured
`base_url` host, and caps the response at 5 MB.

### What is configured

The install flow writes per-capsule env config to
`~/.astrid/home/<principal>/.config/env/<capsule-id>.env.json` with 0600
permissions. These values are read by the capsule at runtime via `env::var`.
`api_key` fields are written as secrets and never logged.

After install the registry picks up the new provider at the next
`astrid.v1.capsules_loaded` broadcast (or at the next `astrid models list`
call, which re-runs discovery).

## When no model is selected

If no LLM provider is configured, or if you have run `astrid models unset`
and not re-selected a model, any prompt fails with:

```
No LLM model is selected. Run `astrid models` to choose one,
or install and configure an LLM provider.
```

The react loop generates this error when the active LLM topic resolves to
nothing -- it never fabricates a default model to try. Fix it with:

```sh
# Show what is available (runs discovery)
astrid models list

# Pick one
astrid models set openai:gpt-5.5

# Or install and configure a provider if none is listed
astrid capsule install @example-org/capsule-openai
```

If `astrid models list` returns "No LLM models available", no provider capsule
is installed or reachable. Check `astrid ps` to confirm a provider capsule is
loaded and `astrid capsule list` to see what is installed.
